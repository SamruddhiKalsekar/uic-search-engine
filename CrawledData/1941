Copy link Four faculty members in computer science are included on an Elsevier list of the top 2% of scientists in their fields for either single-year impact or career impact in 2020. Research Professor Daniel Bernstein, Richard and Loan Hill Professor Ouri Wolfson, and  Distinguished Professor Phillip S. Yu are on the list of the top 2% Bernstein, Yu, and Associate Professor Cornelia Caragea were cited for their single-year impact in 2020, again representing the top 2% in their fields. The list was published in August 2021 by research publishing company Elsevier, which created a publicly available database of more than 100,000 top scientists that provides standardized information on citations, h-index, co-authorship adjusted hm-index, citations to papers in different authorship positions, and a composite indicator. Separate data are shown for career-long and single-year impact. Metrics with and without self-citations and ratio of citations to citing papers are given. Scientists are classified into 22 scientific fields and 176 sub-fields. Career-long data are updated to the end of 2020. The selection is based on the top 100,000 by c-score, which measures the scientific impact of scientists and ranks all scientists from highest to lowest, or a percentile rank of 2% or above.
