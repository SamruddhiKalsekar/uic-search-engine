Copy link Three UIC computer science faculty, Tanya Berger-Wolf, Barbara Di Eugenio, and Elena Zheleva, are featured speakers at “ AI Humans | a day in the life of ,” the Midwest’s largest artificial intelligence conference focused on social good. It takes place on Dec. 11. Berger Wolf will present a keynote on her Wildbook “Artificial intelligence and citizen science are working together to understand the natural world,” Berger Wolf said. Di Eugenio and Zheleva will speak on a panel about being in positions of leadership in AI.“For me, leadership is about being a mentor—to undergraduates, graduate students, and colleagues,” Di Eugenio said. “When you are a principal investigator on a grant, that’s how research happens. It’s participating in the dialog and trying to affect change.” Zheleva worked in industry before joining the faculty at UIC, and led a data science team. “When I was recruiting, I made sure to include women. Half my team were women,” Zheleva said. The conference will be held at the AON Center. UIC faculty, staff, and students can register at a discount with the code UICAI25.
