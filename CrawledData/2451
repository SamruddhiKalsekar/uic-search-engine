Copy link The biomedical engineering minor is open to engineering students as well as to students in UICâ€™s other undergraduate colleges. We especially recommend this minor for science majors in the College of Liberal Arts or pre-medicine students who want to show future employers that they understand the ways in which engineering principles can be applied to medical problems. The biomedical engineering minor requires 12 semester hours, independent of any prerequisite courses. Many of the prerequisites are courses that UIC science and engineering majors already will have taken as part of their general education requirements, such as math, physics, and biological sciences courses.
