When possible, administrative units are encouraged to use the UIC campus logo and employ a word treatment to highlight their unit name ( similar to how Marketing and Brand Management is listed on the MBM homepage ). There is strength behind the UIC brand and using the campus logo when possible conveys a unified look and feel around campus. Units are encouraged to use the red circle mark as their social media icon. With the increasing use of mobile devices to access social media, the minimalist circle mark works best given the limited space available. When social media feeds are viewed on mobile devices, a unit’s name can be viewed directly to the right of the social media icon eliminating the need to integrate the unit’s name into the social media icon. If you have any questions regarding logo usage, email marketing@uic.edu . To request a logo, use the form on our contact page .
