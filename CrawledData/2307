Once processing begins for each term, enrollment certifications should be submitted to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs within 4- 6 weeks. Students receive an automated notification from the VA when submissions are made. Please note, this processing time may be delayed due to holiday observations which include New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, and Christmas Day or the annual University closure for winter break, which occurs between the fall and spring semesters. Please anticipate additional processing time during these periods. As long as applicants submit all required UIC forms and Veterans Affairs documents, you should be all set. Once submitted/uploaded, if we notice any missing information, forms or documents, we will notify you. Thank you for your patience. Heading link xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?
