Copy link Amirmohammad “Pedram” Rooshenas Rooshenas is teaching a Special Topics course this semester, CS 594, Deep Generative Models. Deep generative models are an essential part of unsupervised computer learning and has many applications in physics and engineering, as well as high-dimensional text and image generation. His current research is focused on advancing energy-based models for structured prediction and physical sciences. Current projects include neural machine translation, neural partial differential equations (PDE) solvers for electrical impedance tomography, and multimodal data modeling. Rooshenas received his bachelor’s of science degree in computer engineering from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran, a master’s degree in information technology engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran and both a master’s degree and PhD in computer science from the University of Oregon. Rooshenas came to UIC from the College of Computing and Informatics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he was an assistant professor. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He also worked several jobs in industry, as a software engineer, project manager, software developer, and Linux system developer. “UIC has a strong team of faculty that are working in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning and being part of this team opens a lot of collaboration opportunities for me,” Rooshenas said.
