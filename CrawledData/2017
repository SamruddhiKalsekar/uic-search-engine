Copy link Junior Jovad Uribe just transferred into the computer science department, and is taking classes in the new data science program. He was a finance major. Q: What prompted you to switch majors? A: I heard about the major through a friend who is a computer science major. I am part of the Quantitative Trading Club Q: Have you chosen a concentration? A: I’ve chosen computer science as my concentration, mainly because I want to build certain applications alongside techniques I want to employ with data. I’ve unofficially declared my minor as business administration. I really like how the program is set up. It provides a lot of concentrations to build domain knowledge of what you want to learn. Q: Do you know what career path you want to pursue? A: As I was entering college I knew I wanted to enter the finance industry. I didn’t know exactly where, so I majored in finance. A major in finance is great if you’re going for a finance career in commercial banking, financial advising, or other qualitative forms of finance—but the other 50 percent of finance is very quantitative. A lot of the hedge fund industry is moving toward data science, and I want to enter the quantitative hedge fund space. This interview was edited for clarity . UIC’s data science degree program here .
