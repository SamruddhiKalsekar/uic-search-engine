Copy link Workers on UIC’s campus are putting together the basement level of our new computer science building, known as the Computer Design Research and Learning Center. The five-story structure will attach to UIC’s existing Science and Engineering Labs building while adding 135,000 square feet of new space. UIC’s computer science department now enrolls over 1,700 undergraduates — more than eight times the number enrolled 15 years ago. The department’s faculty, staff, and classes are presently spread across four buildings on the east campus. The new building is part of UIC’s campus master plan and supported by the Rebuild Illinois capital plan, including a $117.8 million allocation from the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. It will be located at 850 W. Taylor Street, adjacent to the Memorial Grove. A ceremonial groundbreaking was held on July 15, 2021, and the building will open in 2023.
