We wholeheartedly condemn the violence, hatred and bigotry that led to the deaths of five individuals. Each time a tragedy like this occurs, it carries a heavy emotional and physical toll on our community. Your well-being is our primary concern. UIC reinforces its commitment to greater inclusion with the following support resources for students, faculty and staff: UIC Gender and Sexuality Center Therapy Groups. The Campus Advocacy Network Counseling Center. UIC Office for Access and Equity LGBTQ+ Inclusion. UIC Bias Reporting Tool: Bias Reporting & Prevention. At UIC, we believe in the value of diversity and inclusion, and we are proud to be one of the nation’s top 40 “Best of the Best” LGBTQ+ Friendly Colleges and Universities. We must collectively work to live the values of our university — to be inclusive, to treat each other with dignity and respect, and to provide a safe and supportive environment for each other.
