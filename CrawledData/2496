UIC prohibits and will not tolerate sexual misconduct of or by students, employees, patients, applicants for enrollment or employment, or others in its education programs or activities. UIC will take prompt and fair action to eliminate such conduct, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects. Employees and students in violation of this policy may face sanctions up to and including termination or expulsion. The Office for Access and Equity, through its Title IX Coordinator, has the authority to conduct investigations, and then make recommendations in accordance with the relevant University policies for students, employees, patients, applicants, or visitors. UIC encourages good faith reports of sexual misconduct and prohibits retaliation against any person who reports sexual misconduct and/or who participates in a sexual misconduct investigation or resultant disciplinary process. All employees are considered to be responsible employees with the responsibility to report sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator. Employees who are exempted from this reporting requirement are professional or pastoral counselors who provide work-related mental-health counseling, campus advocates who provide confidential victim assistance, and employees who are otherwise prohibited by law from disclosing information received in the course of providing professional care and treatment. The purpose of this policy is to provide such an environment and to and to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., and its implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. Part 106; Section 304 of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (“VAWA”), 20 U.S.C. 1092(f), and its implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R.
