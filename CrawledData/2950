Copy link Here is where you will find all the content from the new UIC Engineering magazine, RISE. Its title is a reference to the words that incoming undergraduates see on the cover of our admissions viewbook: “Chicago is where you will rise.” This one word captures our mission of providing all students with the engineering and computer science education they need to achieve excellence and success. In each issue of this magazine, you will find stories about students, faculty, and alumni who have risen to great heights: through competition wins, successful startups, innovative designs, and groundbreaking approaches in computing. Equally as important, you will learn what the UIC Engineering community is doing to help lift our society and our environment. RISE will address topics of high importance to all of us—such as climate change, cybersecurity, energy conservation, or food safety—and will show you how UIC Engineering faculty, alumni, students, and friends are involved with those issues. Thanks for being part of our first generation of readers! Heading link xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?
