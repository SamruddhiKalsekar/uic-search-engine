Copy link The Counseling Center will continue to offer its services virtually during Fall 2022 due to COVID-19 concerns for health and safety. Though all appointments continue to be virtual, a limited number of staff will be present in the office from 8:30am-5pm Monday-Friday. Masks are required when entering the office. Many of our usual procedures have changed since transitioning to online services due to COVID-19. We are frequently reassessing our procedures to ensure our services are as safe and accessible as possible. Check back often for the latest updates.
