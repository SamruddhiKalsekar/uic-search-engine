Copy link The chart shows the number of new student and employee cases reported to the UIC COVID-19 Contact Tracing & Epidemiology Program, by day, over the past 30 days. Daily COVID-19 incidence (or the occurrence of new cases) is currently approximately 10 cases per day. Compared to the week prior, incidence during the week ending (and including) 12/4/2022 increased approximately 114%. Heading link xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"? Copy link The rolling average of new student and employee cases reported each day to our program are represented using two trend lines, moving left to right, with the heights of lines indicating the number of cases. Cases included campus members who tested positive at a Shield unobserved testing site or any other UI Health testing location, and cases who self-reported a positive test obtained off campus, including home tests. Students who are also employed by the university were classified as students. Employees who work for UI Health and individuals who could not be classified as a student or employee were excluded from this figure. Individuals who tested positive more than once within 90 days were counted as a case only once and plotted on the figure according to the first positive specimen collection date. Heading link xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"? Copy link Raw aggregate data used to generate the figure are provided. Data are sorted by primary affiliation (students first, followed by employees and then the overall population). They are sorted in ascending order by the positive specimen collection date.
