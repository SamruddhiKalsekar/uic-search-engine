Copy link The minor in chemical engineering is open to engineering students as well as students in UICâ€™s other undergraduate colleges: liberal arts and business. We especially recommend this minor for chemistry majors in the College of Liberal Arts who are interested in demonstrating to future employers that they possess an understanding of the ways in which chemistry is applied in engineering. The chemical engineering minor requires between 16 and 18 semester hours, independent of any prerequisite courses. Many of the prerequisites are courses that UIC science and engineering majors already will have taken as part of their general education requirements, such as math, physics, and chemistry courses.
