Why Honors? The UIC Honors College is an option for undergraduate students at UIC. Honors students are seeking high-achieving and are motivated to engage in the many learning opportunities offered at UIC: in the classroom, through research, during service and internship experiences, and from each other. Admitted students typically have strong academic records; well-developed essays demonstrating thoughtful reflection on the essay prompt; extracurricular involvement showing commitment and leadership; unique talents or abilities; and willingness to embrace diversity in both ideas and people.​ Selection into the Honors College is competitive.
