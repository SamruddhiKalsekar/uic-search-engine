Isolation is used to keep someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 away from people who are not sick. We recognize that requiring 7 days of isolation is a departure from the 5-day guidance outlined by the CDC . UIC’s isolation policy recognizes that people can remain contagious until day 8 of illness, according to recent studies. Note: The following guidance is intended for the general campus. UI Health faculty and staff and students who are currently on a clinical rotation or are engaged in patient-facing activities should follow guidance provided by University Health Services contact tracing.
