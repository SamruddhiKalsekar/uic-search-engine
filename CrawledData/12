The department’s faculty, staff, and classes are presently spread across four buildings on the east campus. The new 135,000-square-foot, LEED Gold-certified building will double the department’s capacity. It will include: 16,000 square feet of classroom space Undergraduate learning and community center Dry lab Robotics lab Flexible events space 21 faculty research labs Collaborative learning and teaching spaces A geothermal farm to assist with sustainable heating and cooling The new computer science building is part of UIC’s campus master plan and supported by the Rebuild Illinois capital plan, including a $117.8 million allocation from the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. It will be located at 850 W. Taylor Street, adjacent to the Memorial Grove. A ceremonial groundbreaking was held on July 15, 2021, and the building will open in 2023.
