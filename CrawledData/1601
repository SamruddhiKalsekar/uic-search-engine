Working with media in all its forms, the unit broadens public awareness and understanding of UIC, its missions and partnerships and the achievements of its faculty and students. In addition to outreach through the media, we manage UIC’s own news and information properties including UIC today; two YouTube channels; two Facebook pages; a LinkedIn page; two Twitter feeds; and the UIC Science blog. Public Affairs also serves the campus administration and colleges in crisis communications; works closely with UIC Police and the Environmental Health and Safety Office on emergency communications; and serves all units in cross-campus internal communications. Reporters : Contact Public Affairs Monday-Friday, 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Staff may also be reachable by phone and email after hours. The UIC Public Affairs team is organized on a “beat system,” with staff members assigned to cover different areas of the university. If you are not sure which staff member to contact, call 312-996-3456.
