Copy link Patrick Asztabski, a sophomore, recently transferred into the new data science Q: What prompted you to switch majors? A: I’ve always liked working with statistics and data in general. Statistics is a really valuable discipline for solving some real-life problems. Recently I took a computer science course because I’ve been curious to work with data science and computer programming. When I received an announcement about the creation of the major, I thought, “Wow, this is perfect!” This is what I wanted to do when I chose applied statistics as a major. I wanted to go into data science, but the major didn’t exist then. Q: Have you chosen a concentration? A: I have a few in mind, statistics or social technology studies. I’ve also thought about health data science. Q: What does your semester look like, now that you’ve switched to data science? A: While I was still an applied statistics major, I took STAT 381 Applied Statistical Methods and liked learning the different distribution methods. I like the challenge of translating a problem from English to math and back to English. I really enjoy the specificity of each problem. I also took MCS 260, where I learned Python. This semester, now that I’m in the data science program, I’m taking four courses toward my major: CS 141 Program Design II and CS 151 Mathematical Foundations of Computing, where I’ll learn Java and C++; MATH 310 Applied Linear Algebra; and STAT 382 Statistical Methods and Computing.
