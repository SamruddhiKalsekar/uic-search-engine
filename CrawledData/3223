Copy link Sudip Mazumder was named a UIC Distinguished Researcher of the Year Award for 2019 by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research. This annual research and scholarship award celebrates the efforts of individuals who make exceptional progress advancing knowledge in their research area. Mazumder, who received word of the honor earlier this spring, was named in the Basic Life Sciences category. His research interests include power electronics and devices, with applications including renewable energy, electric vehicles, smart grid, aerospace, biomedicine, and cyber-physical energy systems. He said he was honored to receive this “once in a lifetime, prestigious award” from UIC. Mazumder is a pioneer in the field of power electronics, developing highly successful mechanisms to control the performance of solid-state power conversion systems at the semiconductor device level. According to the award announcement, his work has resulted in a multimillion-dollar sponsored research program with 12 grants in the last three years alone. Mazumder was the driving force behind the development of the Laboratory for Energy and Switching-Electronics Systems at UIC , a power electronics lab that collaborates with top engineering programs in power electronics and major industry partners. He has more than 225 publications in leading peer reviewed journals, given more than 100 presentations, holds 10 patents, and has received invitations to serve on multiple NSF review panels, and as a keynote speaker at NSF sponsored workshops. He serves in multiple editor roles for IEEE publications, and served as an international judge for Google’s Little Box Challenge. Mazumder has supervised more than 40 PhD students, MS students, and postdocs, who are routinely recruited for positions at leading tech and academic institutions. His most recent projects Mazumder teaches courses related to power electronics encompassing analysis, design, optimization and practicalities. He has been with UIC for 18 years, and has more than 25 years of professional experience, holding R&D and design positions in leading industrial organizations. He’s also served as a technical consultant for several industries, and is the president of NextWatt LLC, a small business he established in 2008.
