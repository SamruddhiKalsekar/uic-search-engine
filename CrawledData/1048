Copy link The first year of college brings new experiences and new opportunities. Students become part of a campus community and connect with one another, faculty, staff, and campus organizations. They explore their majors and begin to develop the skills that will serve them throughout their studies, in the workplace, and in life. This transition is often facilitated in first-year seminars – 1-credit or 2-credit courses allowing students to explore specific topics or fields, or required by specific majors.

Students who are in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS), and who are not in the Honors 101 seminar, most often choose LAS 110 “Experience UIC” when taking a seminar. Students in other colleges at UIC generally are required to take a specific first-year seminar (or two-course sequence), and they will be advised into those courses for the appropriate semester.
