Copy link Our department offers two minors: mechanical engineering and industrial engineering. These minors require between 12 and 18 semester hours, along with some prerequisite courses. These minors are a great choice for students pursuing other engineering disciplines who wish to develop and demonstrate expertise in either mechanical or industrial engineering. They also are open to students in UIC’s other undergraduate colleges—the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Business—who want to add engineering coursework to their degrees. Follow the links below for the course catalog pages on each minor. If you are thinking about pursuing a minor, contact your academic advisor to ensure that you meet the requirements and to coordinate these courses in your schedule.
