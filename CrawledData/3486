Copy link Didem Ozevin, associate professor of Civil and Materials Engineering in the UIC College of Engineering, appeared in a CBS 2 News segment about the damaged Lake Shore Drive bridge that led to closures last month and “Right now the load is carried by those towers, so once they remove the towers, the load will transfer from the girder to the expansion joint. And they can make sure that all the stresses are below the limit. And so we can safely use that new retrofitted connection,” Ozevin said.
