Trace Lozano’s efforts to build unity among Latinx communities in his Near West Side neighborhoods, documented and undocumented workers fighting for better conditions, and Black, Latinx and white Chicagoans who organized for political change. From Lozano’s student activism - including his time here at UIC - to his vital legacy that continues to shape the city today, uncover the story of this dynamic leader through original documents, posters and photographs from the Rudy Lozano papers and several other collections from the UIC Library’s Special Collections and University Archives. The exhibit is now on view in the Richard J. Daley Library, third floor, in Special Collections and University Archives. Visitor information is available on the Library website.
