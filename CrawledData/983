Heading link xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"? Copy link What is an international affiliation agreement? At UIC, an international affiliation agreement is defined as any cooperative arrangement (including but not limited to contracts, memoranda of agreements, or letters of intention) between the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois on behalf of UIC, and foreign higher education institution/s or organizations to support academic activities such as student and/or faculty exchanges, direct enrollment, student placement abroad, and curricular collaborations such as cotutelle and degrees offered in cooperation with an international institution. Such agreements must adhere to the International Collaboration Policy . Proposed collaborations with third-party organizations that are not traditional higher education institutions involving outbound mobility of UIC students should be routed through the Study Abroad Proposal Review Committee process. Contact the Study Abroad Office at sao@uic.edu How do you propose or renew an international affiliation agreement? Complete the Agreement Proposal and Approval Form sdconron@uic.edu .
