Copy link * This schedule grants three (3) gift days and one (1) excused/gift day over the December/January holiday break. Group B employees of the UI Hospital and Clinics will receive the gift days as additional floating holidays that may be used any time between December 24, 2021 and June 30, 2022, with supervisor approval. All other Group B employees required to work on the gift days may schedule alternate days off between December 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022. Heading link xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"? Copy link A gift day is a paid day (use of benefit time is not required) provided to leave benefit eligible employees. Essential employees who must work on a designated gift day may use their gift day at a later time in the current fiscal year, with supervisor approval. Unused gift days are not paid out at the time of termination and do not roll over into the next fiscal year. Most non-essential university units are closed on the reduced service days. Leave benefit eligible employees may use accrued vacation leave or floating holidays to be paid on a reduced service day. Non-exempt civil service staff may also take as unpaid or use accrued comp time. Exempt employees without accrued vacation or floating holiday leave cannot take as unpaid. Floating holidays (2 or 4) are “designated holidays” by the president and chancellors. They must be taken in full day increments and must be used in the fiscal year. Unused floating holidays are not paid out at the time of termination and do not roll over into the next fiscal year. While eligible faculty and staff will receive paid holiday time on the Juneteenth holiday, the University of Illinois System never fully closes and essential operations will continue. Holiday usage and pay policies will apply, as they do for other designated holidays. Heading link xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?
