Copy link UIC Engineering offers guaranteed paid internships to all incoming freshmen and transfer students who are able to fulfill the participation requirements. For example, students must maintain a 3.2 GPA each semester in order to maintain program eligibility. Freshmen meet program requirements during their first fall and spring semesters and are placed during the summer. Transfer students meet program requirements over multiple semesters and are placed the summer before their final year or semester on campus. The Guaranteed Paid Internship Program (GPIP) places students in paid positions in one of 42 UIC research laboratories and in other university departments. Student progress of required courses is tracked by the program and once students have met all requirements, they have the opportunity to review open internships before the placement process begins. Students describe GPIP as a significant force in accelerating their trajectory into future internships after their sophomore and junior years. The program reflects UIC Engineering’s commitment to helping our students lay the best possible groundwork for post-graduation career success.
